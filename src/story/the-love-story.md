# The Love Story | By Vikas

## Context

Namaste 🙏

My Name is Vikas (which means development)
and i am an Indian guy.

So , as an Indian guy i grew up watching
Indian movies.

And in a lot of Indian movies **(not all)** ,
the story revolves around a guy (hero) 🦸‍♂️ who
sees a beautiful woman (heroine) 🦸‍♀️ , falls in love
with her . After few efforts done by hero 🦸‍♂️ , the
heroine 🦸‍♀️ accepts him and falls in love with him as well.

Then starts the problem where heroine's father 🧓
(usually a very big and powerful personality 👊 , so
much powerful that he can even kill anyone like killing a
bug for instance) (and yes no law can do anything to him)
refuses hero as his daughter's partner ❌ and tries to kill hero 🦸‍♂️ .

After a lot of tries and efforts finally the villian
,oh sorry , the heroin's father 🧓 accepts hero 🦸‍♂️ ✅
and the story ends happily 😃.

So this story is also similar to those
types of stories.

**Note that: similar ≠ same** <br>
**At least in this story . I promise.**
**Also this is a really beautiful story.**
**Again i promise (atleast according to me).**

So without any further delay let us start the story.

**_Enjoy the story 😊_**

## The Starting of the story

A teenager named vikas
<span class='me'>yes , i imagine myself as the hero and
because i am the writer of the story i have the power to

His friend Nikhil <span class='me'>yes i have a friend
in real life named 'nikhil'</span>

anywhere except in my school</span>
<span class='me'>And also i am among those animals
who do not leave their shelter so often</span>
