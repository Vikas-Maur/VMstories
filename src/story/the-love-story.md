## Context

Namaste üôè

My Name is Vikas (which means development)
and i am an Indian guy.

So , as an Indian guy i grew up watching
Indian movies.

And in a lot of Indian movies **(not all)** ,
the story revolves around a guy (hero) ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è who
sees a beautiful woman (heroine) ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è , falls in love
with her . After few efforts done by hero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è , the
heroine ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è accepts him and falls in love with him as well.

Then starts the problem where heroine's father üßì
(usually a very big and powerful personality üëä , so
much powerful that he can even kill anyone like killing a
bug for instance) (and yes no law can do anything to him)
refuses hero as his daughter's partner ‚ùå and tries to kill hero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è .

After a lot of tries and efforts finally the villian
,oh sorry , the heroin's father üßì accepts hero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚úÖ
and the story ends happily üòÉ.

So this story is also similar to those
types of stories.

**Note that: similar ‚â† same** <br>
**At least in this story . I promise.**
**Also this is a really beautiful story.**
**Again i promise (atleast according to me).**

So without any further delay let us start the story.

**_Enjoy the story üòä_**

## The Starting of the story

A teenager named vikas
<span class='me'>yes , i imagine myself as the hero and
because i am the writer of the story i have the power to
make myself hero</span>
had fallen in love ‚ù§.

His friend Nikhil <span class='me'>yes i have a friend
in real life named 'nikhil'</span>
comes to hang out with him (as what friends' do).

<span class='me'>Although my friend does not meets me
anywhere except in my school</span>
<span class='me'>And also i am among those animals
who do not leave their shelter so often</span>
<span class='me'>Although there is a whole story/reason behind it</span>

So yeah , going forwards with the story ,
the following conversation happens between
both of them:

### The Conversation Starts

<div class='conversation'>

<span>Nikhil</span> Hey! Hi Vikas.
<div class='me'>I wanted to write üôè**namaste** here but friends do not
greet each other with Namaste **yet** in India , but i think friends do not say
'hey' or 'hi' as well. They just start talking. But yeah i did it for the sake of the story.
</div>

<span>Vikas</span> Hi Nikhil.

<div class='me'>
I infact don't think so that i or he had said me 'hi' 
ever.
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> Hey Vikas , is everything okay? Means you look strange today.

<div class='me'>
Vikas looks strange today , coz in movies 
hero's affection for heroine could be seen through
his face. And yeah the same rule follows here.
</div>

<span>Vikas</span> Oh! yeah . Everything's fine!!
Actually your brother has fallen in love.

<div class='me'>
Note that just for the sake of story the 2 characters are
speaking english . Otherwise it would have been hindi (with
few words of english mixed in it)
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> What! My brother . In this small age he is
doing these kind of things. Now he's gone. Now mom will not leave
him.

Ah!!!! Hey vikas , but i don't have a brother. Why are you fooling me?

<div class='me'>
Ah!!!! Poor characters. 
They don't know i make them speak their words.
Otherwise i am sure my friend would not have said that line.
</div>

<span>Vikas</span> What are you speaking? I am talking about myself.

<span>Nikhil</span> Oh!!!! 
(vikas blushes ü§≠ !!!!!)

Who's she? Is she in our school or someone
in your neighbourhood.

<span>Vikas</span> Oh! She is everywhere , inside my heart and outside it
, inside my mind and outside it . I can always see her image in my eyes.

<span>Nikhil</span> Tell me more about here.

<span>Vikas</span> Okay!
She is really really really beautiful.
Even the most beautiful girl in this whole
world is nothing infront of her.

She's just so so so so much beautiful.

I can just look towards her all day .

Also she's a very good and pure hearted . 
She cares and loves everyone around her , every animal
even insects and plants. She do not discriminate between
gender,race,caste,religion etc. 
With great power comes great responsibility.
And yup ! she's both responsible and  powerful.

Although people **(only humans)** have cheated her a lot of times.
A lot of times people had misused her love and affection.

Although she tries to tolerate it very much.
But yeah **humans** are **foolish**.
I wish humans get intelligent and smart soon.

But yeah , sometimes she also gets very angry. 
Really Really angry.

And when she's angry , then she does not thinks about anyone.
The anger is as large as her love for everyone.
Then its next to impossible for anyone to make her calm again.

And then she just starts breaking all the items,accessories,things etc
which are present in her house.
She does not cares if any insect or plant or any animal or even any
human gets an injury or maybe even fullstop to life .

And she continues to destroy everything until and unless she gets relaxed and calmed.
Although no-one can guarantee when will she be calmed.
And also she does not listen to anyone while she's angry.

But yeah! she's still very good and yes after that she just tries to 
undo the destruction she created unlike those who cheats her or those who
says nothing to those cheaters and put their heads down thinking that they
could do nothing.

<span>Nikhil</span> Oh!!!! Looks like she's got serious anger issues.
And what about her family?

<span>Vikas</span> Oh! Her father is a really really big personality.
He's got everthing whether its power or wealth.
If he even thinks to kill someone then the person gets killed within
few seconds after his thinking.

No matter who the person is . No matter how many people are.
No matter even if the person is jeff bezos or elon musk or the prime
minister or president or anyone of any country.

Although i think , no , infact i am sure that even she can do that too .
Just make her angry . You will see the consequences yourself.

**‚ö† Try to make her angry at your's and your community's and your nation's and your world's <br> own risk**

‚úÖ Recommended to not try. But yeah , who can stop humans from trying.

<span>Nikhil</span> Don't you think you are exaggerating very much. Or I
think you are kidding with me. Do you think i am a fool or what?
Who will trust you ? Okay i agree that she might break/destroy things
in her own house but how can she or her father kill anyone. And at such an
ease as you are speaking.

<span>Vikas</span> But , bro why will i lie to you?
And yes vikas tries to speak truth most of the times.

<div class='me'>
Note: that vikas' characteristics are those of the story's writer.
And the writer is me (vikas).
And yes i made myself hero.(I know i am telling this again).
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> Okay! So tell me her and her father's name.

<span>Vikas</span> Her name is 'earth' and her father's name is 'universe'.

<div class='me'>
YUP , i made universe her father coz its my story.
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> What? what are you speaking?

<span>Vikas</span> Ah!!!! I am speaking her and her father's name as you asked.

<span>Nikhil</span> Could you please explain what you want to say.

<span>Vikas</span> Well i am wanting to say that mother earth is the most
beautiful thing in this whole earth <div class='me d-inline-block'>Huh!</div> 
and even in this whole universe (atleast for humans). No , girl can compete with her.

And yeah she's both loving and caring. She takes care of everyone and everything in 
this planet. From a small bacteria to large whales (including **stupid humans**).

And yup , when she becomes angry she can even destroy the whole city or even
the whole world at an ease without caring for anyone and without listening to
anyone whether its government or its any big influential powerful extremely rich
person.

And after that destruction she tries to recover everthing back to normal.

But yeah , **stupid humans** makes her angry all the time.
I don't know who tries to destroy their own house in replace
of pain and finally fullstop.

And also if she's not there , then it will automatically give us
a fullstop. And when the 'end' will come no government , no power 
, no request , no anything will be able to stop her.

And yes if you are thinking that you will go to Mars with Elon
or to moon with Bezos and live there , then let me tell you
that i don't think you will be able to.

Firstly it will still take decades for us to even settle on moon.
Secondly , only the top , extremely rich people would be able to leave first.
Then , the turn of very rich people , then rich people will come.
And this will amount to few thousands of perople at max. (Most probably).
And this will only take a few decades.
And i don't think that mother earth will wait for so long.
Also the destruction to environment , when they will leave the planet
will just accelerate the process of 'the end'.

So , if you are planning to leave then better you get very very very very
rich soon enough. Or if you are bezos or elon then you need not to become
very rich. coz its your company. And yes this is a business advice to both 
of you. Charge a lot of money . Do it for atleast more than billions of dollars.
You guys are saving lives (of few thousand out of billion people). I think
you deserve all the money of those rich guys who had booked the seats. So do not
leave the chance. If this happens as told above then i want , wish and command you
both to become what's above 10s of trillions dollar worth.

Poor **stupid humans**
Poor **me** who is also a **human**
Poor **other living beings** who think they can share 
their world with **Poor stupid humans**.

All this makes me feel that everbody is really really 
poor.

I wish everyone of us would be rich.

Although 'The end' has not come yet! Oh!!
That means that there's still time. There's still
time to get smart. (Or extremely very very rich. And also good relationship with elon and bezos)

That means that i can get rich . (Here richness means smartness and not literally "rich".)
Infact all of us could get rich.

Although if you do not want to get rich then you must be really really extremely rich
along with good relationships with bezos and elon.

Okay !! So what can i do?
Atleast i promise that i will contribute (according to my financial power)
in making our mother earth pretty again as she was once.
I promise i will do this from the first time i will earn money till the 
last time i will. (infact till my fullstop)

<div class='me'>
I promise that in real life.
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span>Hmmmmmm!!!! Okay , just wait for a minute bro. I had called
mental hospital . They are coming . Wait for few minutes . 

<div class='me'>
This marks the ending of the story.
</div>

</div>


## Conclusion

At the end i want to say that 

Firstly i know the ending line of Nikhil could be
better . But sorry i am unable to think of a better ending.
If you could see comment section below (at the time of writing this
story i have not made a comment section , i **might** add the comment section in future)
then you can comment below , whatever the ending you had thought.
If you can't see a comment section then you can go to [Contact Page](/pages/contact)
and contact me there.
Or if you think that ending is perfect , **Well , thank you!! I knew i am talented**

But yup , as told above **"The end"** has not come yet.
And hence i would you to make the above promise as well.
Otherwise , your future generation , your children will die
and the **Stupid humans** will be the reason for it.
Do you really want that **Stupid humans** must be the reason for it?
Coz if they are then the fullstop will be extremely very very painful 
as well.

Also i don't feel the need to mention basic things to keep
the environment clean and healthy.(If you want then you can
tell me that on [Contact Page](/pages/contact))

If you are an animator , then you can contact me : [Contact Page](/pages/contact)
and we can animate this story as well . (I don't earn money as of now. So , please

its good for anyone of us.
