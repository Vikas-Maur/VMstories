## Context

Namaste üôè

My Name is Vikas (ForYourInfo : 'vikas' means development) <br>
and I am an Indian guy.
![India's flag](/assets/svg/india.svg)

So,as an Indian guy I grew up watching
Indian movies.

And in a lot of Indian movies **(not all)**,
the story revolves around a guy (hero) ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è who
sees a beautiful woman (heroine) ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è , falls in love
with her . After few efforts and fights done by hero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è , the
heroine ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è accepts him and falls in love with him as well.

Then starts the problem where the heroine's father üßì
(usually a very big and powerful personality üëä , who controls the full government,
and is the decider of how much a person should live). 
(and yes no law can do anything to him coz govt. is in his hands)
refuses hero as his daughter's partner ‚ùå and tries to kill the hero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è .

After a lot of tries and efforts , finally the villian
,oh sorry , the heroin's father üßì accepts hero ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚úÖ
and the story ends happily üòÉ.

So this story is also similar to those
types of stories.

**Note that: similar ‚â† same** <br>
**At least in this story . I promise.** <br>
**Also,this is a really beautiful story.**
**Again I promise (at least according to me).**

So without any further delay let us start the story.

**_Enjoy the story üòä_**

## The Starting of the story

A teenager named vikas
<span class='me'>yes , I imagine myself as the hero and
because i am the writer of the story I have the power to
make myself hero</span>
had fallen in love ‚ù§.

His friend Nikhil <span class='me'>yes I have a friend
in real life named 'nikhil'</span>
comes to hang out with him (as what friends' do).

<span class='me'>Although my friend does not meets me
anywhere except in my school</span>
<span class='me'>And also I am among those animals
who do not leave their shelter so often</span>
<span class='me'>Although there is a whole story/reason behind it</span>

So yeah , going forwards with the story ,
the following conversation happens between
both of them:

### The Conversation Starts

<div class='conversation'>

<span>Nikhil</span> Namaste üôè Vikas.

<span>Vikas</span> Namaste üôè Nikhil.

<div class='me'>
Although friends do start talking right away
without saying üôè but yeah sometimes you need
to do somethings to promote your culture as well.
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> Hey Vikas , is everything okay? Means you look strange today.

<div class='me'>
Vikas looks strange today , coz in movies 
hero's affection for heroine could be seen through the
hero's face. And yeah the same rule follows here.
</div>

<span>Vikas</span> Oh! yeah . Everything's fine!! (blushes too much üò≥üò≥üò≥) <br>
Actually,your brother has fallen in love ‚ù§‚ù§.

<div class='me'>
Note that just for the sake of the story the 2 characters are
speaking english . Otherwise,it would have been hindi (with
few words of english mixed in it)
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> What! My brother . In this small age he is
doing these kind of things. Now he's gone. Now mom will not leave
him.

Ah!!!! Hey vikas , but i don't have a brother. Why are you fooling me?

<div class='me'>
Ah!!!! Poor characters. 
They don't know i make them speak their words.
Otherwise i am sure my friend would not have said that line.
</div>

<span>Vikas</span> What are you speaking? I am talking about myself.

<span>Nikhil</span> Oh!!!! 
(vikas blushes ü§≠ !!!!!)

So,this is the thing which has given
glow to your face.

Well,so tell me about her.
Who's she? Is she in our school or someone
in your neighbourhood.

<span>Vikas</span> Oh! She is everywhere , inside my heart and outside it
, inside my mind and outside it . I can always see her image in my eyes.

<div class='me'>
Oh ! What a dialog i have written. <br>
Just seems like a film is going on. <br>
So creative i am.
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> Tell me more about her.

<span>Vikas</span> Okay! <br>
So she is really really really beautiful.
Even the most beautiful girl in this whole
world is nothing infront of her.

She's just so so so so much beautiful.

I can just look at her all day .

Along with beauty she has a very good and pure heart as well. 
She cares and loves everyone around her , every animal ,
even insects and plants. She do not discriminate between
gender , race , caste , religion etc. 

With great power comes great responsibility.
And yup ! she's both responsible and  powerful.
She's is very very rich and wealthy. She has so
much bank balance that even banks could not balance that.

<div class='me'>
This last line is not created by me. <br>
Although i don't remember in which movie i had heard that line.
But yeah , continuing the story!!!
</div>

Coz she's just so innocent and good from her
heart , whenever she sees some needy person , she tries 
to help the needy through whatever means she could.

Although a lot of times , people had misused this 
pure hearted nature of her and looted wealth in 
the name of their needs.

But yup , her good heart tries to forgive them but
yeah those **stupid humans** thinks that 
it is her weak point and that they are smart.
But the **stupid humans** don't know that it is not the case with her at least. <br>
I wish humans get intelligent and smart soon.

And sometimes this nature of **stupid humans** 
becomes too much for her to tolerate and she becomes 
very very very angry.

And when she's angry , then she does not thinks about anyone.
The anger is as large as her love for everyone.
And then its next to impossible for anyone to make her calm again.

Then starts the destruction phase where each and every item
of her house faces serious injuries and few even fullstop.
And obviously she does not cares if any insect or plant or any animal or any 
anybody's head or leg or any other part gets an injury or maybe even fullstop to life .

She continues to destroy everything until and unless she gets relaxed and calmed.
Although no-one can guarantee when she will be calmed.
And also she does not listen to anyone while she's angry.

But yeah! she's still very good and yes after that she just tries to 
undo the destruction she created unlike those who do not even feel sorry 
for cheating with her trust for the sake of money/wealth.

<span>Nikhil</span> Oh!!!! Looks like she's got serious anger issues.
And what about her family?

<span>Vikas</span> Oh! Her father is a really really big personality.
He's got everything , whether its power or wealth.
Anything he wishes or thinks for , is done as soon as he finishes 
wishing/thinking for it.And then it doesn't matter whether the 
wish requires someone to be killed as well.

No matter who the person is . No matter how many people are.
No matter even if the person is jeff bezos or elon musk or the prime
minister or president or anyone of any country <br>
he is the one above all of them.

Although i think , no , infact i am sure that even she is that much powerful too .
Just make her angry . You will see the consequences yourself.

**‚ö†Caution: Do not try to make her angry and if you are trying then there's a risk of fullstop of yours' and your family's and your friends' and your neighbourhood's ........**

‚úÖ Recommended to not try. But yeah , who can stop humans from trying.

<div class='me'>
Although , right now i am only trying to stop humans from trying. <br>
I think i have got guts for that exceptionally hard task. <br>
If i would be a prime minister or president or hold some power in
government <br> i would have made a super strict and unbreakable law about
not messing with her.
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> Don't you think you are exaggerating very much. Or I
think you are kidding with me. Do you think i am a fool or what?
Who will trust you ? Okay i agree that she might break few items
of her house. But how can she or her father be so powerful. And you say
that she do not care even if , while the so called <strong>destruction phase</strong>
,is happening she won't take care of someone getting hurt , don't she know
how wrong it is!! 
Anybody could say that you are lying.

<span>Vikas</span> But , bro why will i lie to you?
And yes vikas tries to speak truth most of the times.

<div class='me'>
Note: that vikas' characteristics are those of the story's writer.
And the writer is me (vikas).
And yes i made myself hero.(I know i am telling this again).
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> Okay! So tell me her and her father's name.

<span>Vikas</span> Her name is 'mother earth' and her father's name is 'universe'.

<div class='me'>
YUP , i made universe her father coz its my story.
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span> What? what are you speaking?

<span>Vikas</span> Ah!!!! I am speaking her and her father's name as you asked.

<span>Nikhil</span> Could you please stop fooling me . I am just leaving.
You already had irritated me very much so far.

<span>Vikas</span> But what wrong did i say ? 
Well i just said that mother earth is the most
beautiful thing in this whole earth <div class='me d-inline-block'>Huh!</div> 
and even in this whole universe (atleast for humans).
No , girl can compete with her.

And yeah she's both loving and caring. She takes care of everyone and everything in 
this planet. From a small bacteria to large whales (including **stupid humans**).

And yup , when she becomes angry she can even destroy the whole city or even
the whole world at an ease without caring for anyone and without listening to
anyone whether its government or its any big influential powerful extremely rich
person.

And after that destruction she tries to recover everthing back to normal.

But yeah , **stupid humans** makes her angry all the time.
I don't know who tries to destroy their own house in replace
of pain and finally fullstop.

And also if she's not there , then it will automatically give us
a fullstop. And when **the end** will come no government , no power 
, no request , no anything will be able to stop her.

And yes if you are thinking that you will go to Mars with Elon
or to moon with Bezos and live there , then let me tell you
that i don't think you will be able to.

Firstly it will still take decades for us to even settle on moon. (So forget about mars atleast)

Secondly , only the top , extremely very very very rich people would be able to leave first.
Then , the turn of very very very rich people , then very very rich people will come.

And this will amount to few thousands of perople at max. (Most probably).
And this only will take a few decades as well.
And i don't think that mother earth will wait for so long.

She's getting angry day by day. And day by day **human stupidity rate** 
is increasing as well.
Also the destruction to environment , when they will leave the planet ,
will just accelerate the process of **'the end'**.

So , if you are planning to leave then better you get extremely very very very very
rich soon enough. Or if you are bezos or elon then you need not to become
very rich. coz its your company. 

And yes this is a business advice to both 
of you. Charge a lot of money . Do it for atleast more than billions of dollars.
You guys are saving lives (of few thousands (if not hundreds) out of billions). I think
you deserve a lot of the money , those rich guys (who had booked the seats) have in their 
pockets. So , do not hesitate. If this happens as told above then i want , wish and command you
both to become what's above 10s of trillions dollar worthful individuals.

Poor **stupid humans** <br>
Poor **me** who is also a **human** <br>
Poor **other living beings** who think they can share 
their world with **Poor stupid humans**.

All this makes me feel that everbody is really really 
poor.

I wish everyone of us would be rich.

Although **'The end'** has not come yet! <br>
Oh!! That means that there's still time. There's still
time to get smart. <br>
(Or extremely very very very very rich along with good relationships with both elon and bezos.
coz you can't take risk of just befriending any one of them only).

That means that i can get rich . (Here richness means smartness and not literally "rich").
Infact all of us could get rich.

Although if you do not want to get rich then you must be really really extremely very very very very rich
along with good relationships with bezos and elon.

Okay !! So what can i do? <br>
Atleast i promise that i will contribute (according to my financial power)
in making our mother earth pretty again as she was once. <br>
Along with basic care for the environment.

<div class='me'>
You can know what i do in real life for the environment
in the conclusion section
</div>

I promise i will do this from the first time i will earn money till the 
last time i will. (infact till my fullstop). <br>
Although as of now i don't earn money. SOOOOOO yeah!

<div class='me'>
I promise that in real life.
</div>

<span>Nikhil</span>Hmmmmmm!!!! Okay , just wait for a minute bro. I had called
mental hospital . They are coming . Wait for few minutes . 

<div class='me'>
This marks the ending of the story.
</div>

</div>


## Conclusion

At the end i want to say that 

Firstly i know the ending line of Nikhil could be
better . But sorry i am unable to think of a better ending.

If you could see comment section below (at the time of writing this
story i have not made a comment section , i **might** add the comment section in future)
then you can comment below , whatever the ending you had thought. <br>
If you can't see a comment section then you can go to [Contact Page](/pages/contact)
and contact me there.

Or if you think that ending is perfect , **Well , thank you!! I knew i am talented**.
You can appreciate me about that in comment or [Contact Page](/pages/contact).

But yup , as told above **"The end"** has not come yet.
And hence i would like , wish and command you to make the above promise as well.
Otherwise , your future generation , your children will die
and the **Stupid humans** will be the reason for it.
Do you really want that **Stupid humans** must be the reason for it?
Coz if they are, then the fullstop will be extremely very very painful 
as well.

Also i don't feel the need to mention basic things to keep
the environment clean and healthy.(If you want then you can
tell me that on [Contact Page](/pages/contact))

otherwise they might remain **Stupid human** and i don't think
its good for anyone of us.

As of now i had firstly made the above promise. <br>
Also , as a small step , i don't throw wrappers or any other
thing on the roads or parks or anywhere else.

<div class='me'>
Although in home , i sometimes do throw the wrappers and stuff 
anywhere . So , does that counts too ?
